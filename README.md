## The User Experience

### Strategy

This project is designed with the aim to showcase the my skills and progression in learning the HTML5 and CSS3 coding languages through the Code Institute web development diploma course with a simple website, using my own resources and knowledge to create an example of a real world scenario for a customer requiring a website to show potential visitors their Mountain Bike Center why they should visit and what is available through them.

### - User Stories

**First Time Visitor goals** -

a. As a first time visitor I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and what the business offers.

b. I want to be able to easily navigate the site without having to use the browsers back/forward buttons at any time.

c. I want to be able to easily access the business social media platforms to further assess the suitablility of the business for my needs.

d. I want to be able to see proof of previous customer visits through the use of a Gallery or Review page.

**Returning Visitor goals** -

a. As a returning visitor I want to be able to see up to date reviews or photos on the websites Gallery to see they are active on the business website.

b. I want to be able to easily book a visit to the place of business once I am happy with the service they provide.

**Frequent Visiter goals** -

a. As a frequent visitor I want to see updates for opening times and seasonal dates available for future bookings.

b. I want to see new features as the website expands.

******

### Scope

Taking the user goals into account I decided to start with four main content pages:

**Home Page** - This would provide users with information on the "What, Where and Why" the business is about and why they should choose this business, along with reviews from previous visitors.

**Services Page** - This would provide details of what the user can expect and a price list of the services provided by the business.

**Gallery Page** - This would show users images of previous visitors experiences at the center.

**Booking Page** - This would allow users to book a visit to the site.

With these main pages there would also be links to the social media accounts of the business, allowing users to see more up-to-date experiences of other visitors at the center and any events that the business may promote.

******

### Structure

With the website starting out very simply, the navigation layout is linear and encourages the user to read information about the business, what the business provides, view some of the previous users experiences and then lastly make a booking.

#### Wireframes

All Wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

The wireframes shown here are the ideas for the initial layout of the website. Some styling has been changed since testing to allow for a better user experience and improve accessibility.

## The User Interface

### Surface

#### Colours

I used [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%2309EA69&sub=1) to research the colourscheme for the site and decided to use colours from different colourschemes for the final website.

**#f7f2cb** - I chose this colour as an "earthy white" approach for the visible backgrounds of each page. This was partly to help with accessibility as a darker background will have taken longer to load. It also helps the site appear light without the use of a basic white. I also used this colour for the menu text and content text. This was because the colour stood out from the background and also helped with the consistency and flow of the website colourschemes.

**#4c4b16** - I used this colour for the header, footer and content boxes. This was to give the website a "forresty" feel to imply to the user that the website is related to the outdoors in some way. It stands out from the background colour above but is not too dark as to distract the user from the website content. The content boxes are slightly transparent so the background images are still visible through them, but not so much that the background takes away the attention of the user.

**#e7b10a** - This colour was used for the Fazz-Tracks logo, all headers in the page content, the social media links in the footer, the submit button on the booking page and also the active class/hover underline in the menu. I decided to use this as it stood out from the #4c4b16 (green) and caught the users attention, allowing them to identify parts of the site content I wanted to stand out to the user.

#### Typography

The fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The 'Poppins' font has been used for the generic content text of the website. I chose this font as it is easy to read and provides the user with a slightly different font to a generic website font. The 'sans-serif' font is used as the fallback font as a generic content font.

The 'Roboto Mono' font has been used for the h1 and h2 headers on the website as it stands nice and bold against the other content and is easy to read. The 'helvetica' font is used as the fallback font as a generic heading font.

## Features

#### Page Navigation

<details><summary>Mobile Header</summary>
<img src="assets/images/mobile-header.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the header in mobile view">>
</details>

<details><summary>Desktop Header</summary>
<img src="assets/images/desktop-header.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the header in desktop view">
</details>

On mobile devices the header appears as the "Fazz-Tracks" logo to the left with a "solid bar" icon on the right. The solid bar icon allows the user to toggle the navigation menu into view by clicking on it. On larger screens the navigation toggle icon dissapears and the navigation links appear as text. These navigation links have an underline feature showing the current page the user is on and also have a hover feature, showing the user the text acts as a link by showing an underline.

#### Footer

The footer on each page contains links to various social media websites. These links open in a new tab and represent the social media accounts the business would be using in a real life scenario.

#### Index Page

<details><summary>Index Page in Mobile view</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Index Page in Tablet view</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Index Page in Desktop view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/desktop-index.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the index page in desktop view">
</details>

On mobile devies, the three content boxes appear in a single column showing each content box in order, followed by three visitor reviews. On tablet screens, this view changes to show just two reviews next to each other to use the extra space, but not look too generic at the same time by having three content boxes with three review boxes below them. All three reviews are shown on larger/desktop screens and the content boxes appear next to each other, rather than below each other, to use up the extra space provided.

#### Services Page

<details><summary>Services Page in Mobile view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/mobile-services.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the services page in mobile view">
</details>

<details><summary>Services Page in Desktop view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/desktop-services.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the services page in desktop view">
</details>

The services page appears in a single column on mobile and tablet devices. This changes when viewed on larger/desktop screens as the content appears next to each other and two images also appear to give the user more interest.

#### Gallery Page

<details><summary>Gallery Page in Mobile view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/mobile-gallery.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the gallery page in mobile view">
</details>

<details><summary>Gallery Page in Tablet view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/tablet-gallery.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the gallery page in tablet view">
</details>

All images in the Gallery appear in a single column on mobile devices. On tablet/larger screens, this changes to three columns with space around the outside, giving the users a better experience on the gallery page.

#### Booking Page

<details><summary>Booking Page in Mobile view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/mobile-booking.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the booking page in mobile view">
</details>

<details><summary>Booking Page in Tablet view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/tablet-booking.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the booking page in tablet view">
</details>

<details><summary>Booking Page in Desktop view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/desktop-booking.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the booking page in desktop view">
</details>

On mobile devices, the booking page only consists of the booking form itself. On tablet screens this changes to the booking form on one side with an image opposite. This changes again on larger/desktop screens as an image will now appear on both sides of the booking form, giving the user more to look at.

#### Confirmation of booking

<details><summary>Confirmation Page in Tablet view</summary>
<img src="assets/images/tablet-confirm.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the booking page in tablet view">
</details>

On completion of the booking form, the "Submit" button takes the user to a confirmation page letting the user know the booking has been successful and the form has worked. It also lets the user know they can return to the main site using the links at the top of the page.

******

## Future Implementations

1. To create functionality in the booking form. This would include the correct formatting of input sections (Only allow future dates in date field, must only be eleven digits in the phone number field ect.), and to add the ability to contact a back-end server in order to store customers booking details.

2. To add a map function to the website, allowing the user to view Google Maps in a window to see where the business is located.

3. To add a page for customer reviews to be imported and updated on the Home page after approval from the business owner and for reviews to be cycled through after refreshing the Home page.

4. To add a page for visitors to be able to upload their own images and videos from their experiences at Fazz-Tracks and display them on the Gallery page.

5. To implement the ability to view images in the Gallery as a larger image and cycle through them.
