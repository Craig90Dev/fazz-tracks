## The User Experience

### Strategy

This project is designed with the aim to showcase the my skills and progression in learning the HTML5 and CSS3 coding languages through the Code Institute web development diploma course with a simple website, using my own resources and knowledge to create an example of a real world scenario for a customer requiring a website to show potential visitors their Mountain Bike Center why they should visit and what is available through them.

### - User Stories

**First Time Visitor goals** -

a. As a first time visitor I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and what the business offers.

b. I want to be able to easily navigate the site without having to use the browsers back/forward buttons at any time.

c. I want to be able to easily access the business social media platforms to further assess the suitablility of the business for my needs.

d. I want to be able to see proof of previous customer visits through the use of a Gallery or Review page.

**Returning Visitor goals** -

a. As a returning visitor I want to be able to see up to date reviews or photos on the websites Gallery to see they are active on the business website.

b. I want to be able to easily book a visit to the place of business once I am happy with the service they provide.

**Frequent Visiter goals** -

a. As a frequent visitor I want to see updates for opening times and seasonal dates available for future bookings.

b. I want to see new features as the website expands.

### Scope

Taking the user goals into account I decided to start with four main content pages:

**Home Page** - This would provide users with information on the "What, Where and Why" the business is about and why they should choose this business, along with reviews from previous visitors.

**Services Page** - This would provide details of what the user can expect and a price list of the services provided by the business.

**Gallery Page** - This would show users images of previous visitors experiences at the center.

**Booking Page** - This would allow users to book a visit to the site.

With these main pages there would also be links to the social media accounts of the business, allowing users to see more up-to-date experiences of other visitors at the center and any events that the business may promote.

### Structure

With the website starting out very simply, the navigation layout is linear and encourages the user to read information about the business, what the business provides, view some of the previous users experiences and then lastly make a booking.

The wireframes shown here are the ideas for the initial layout of the website. Some styling has been changed since testing to allow for a better user experience and improve accessibility.

## The User Interface

### Surface

#### Colours

I used [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%2309EA69&sub=1) to research the colourscheme for the site and decided to use colours from different colourschemes for the final website.

**#f7f2cb** - I chose this colour as an "earthy white" approach for the visible backgrounds of each page. This was partly to help with accessibility as a darker background will have taken longer to load. It also helps the site appear light without the use of a basic white. I also used this colour for the menu text and content text. This was because the colour stood out from the background and also helped with the consistency and flow of the website colourschemes.

**#4c4b16** - I used this colour for the header, footer and content boxes. This was to give the website a "forresty" feel to imply to the user that the website is related to the outdoors in some way. It stands out from the background colour above but is not too dark as to distract the user from the website content. The content boxes are slightly transparent so the background images are still visible through them, but not so much that the background takes away the attention of the user.

**#e7b10a** - This colour was used for the Fazz-Tracks logo, all headers in the page content, the social media links in the footer, the submit button on the booking page and also the active class/hover underline in the menu. I decided to use this as it stood out from the #4c4b16 (green) and caught the users attention, allowing them to identify parts of the site content I wanted to stand out to the user.

#### Typography

The fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The 'Poppins' font has been used for the generic content text of the website. I chose this font as it is easy to read and provides the user with a slightly different font to a generic website font. The 'sans-serif' font is used as the fallback font as a generic content font.

The 'Roboto Mono' font has been used for the h1 and h2 headers on the website as it stands nice and bold against the other content and is easy to read. The 'helvetica' font is used as the fallback font as a generic heading font.
